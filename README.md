# k2k-sample

A sample exercising the python-keystoneclient calls I expect to make while
adding keystone 2 keystone federation support in Horizon/django_openstack_auth

Previous history can be found at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/160851

This code is dependent on python-keystoneclient including this under review patch
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/207585/
I'd make a requirements.txt for this if I knew how. Suggestions welcome!
